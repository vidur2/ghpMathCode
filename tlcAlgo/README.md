# TLC Puzzle
Under certain axioms, derive 'TC' from 'TL'.
Checks all permuations of TL by iterating through them in a tree. Uses a breadth first aproach. Failed to find the solution. Current theory is that it is impossible (incomplete system).

## Structure
The axoims are coded in tlc_struct.rs, and the tree search is in main.rs.
